## P1-Drag-tape-feeder

This project is an open source, modular, 3D printable Lego compatible drag feeder.

Lego pins are spaced at exactly 8mm, and this mounting system lets you do half widths which gives you an indexed solution for 4mm widths.  
This lets you pick any required tape width and quickly build a feeder using a Lego base sheet to match.

Each component block is printed as two parts and then snapped together.  The base part controls the tape depth, and the cover parts let you choose what configuration you want.

The [Arcus-3D-P1 Drag tape feeder](https://hackaday.io/project/160857) is open source hardware. This github repository hosts the [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org) source and the rendered STL images for quick access.

If you are the 'blazing forward without instructions' type, the minimum you need to know is: Print these STL files using a 0.3mm nozzle on a relatively well tuned 3D printer. For further instructions and caveats, see [the web page](https://hackaday.io/project/160857).
